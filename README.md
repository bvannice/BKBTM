# TMD BOX OFFICE REVENUE PREDICTIONS
Metadata from past films from The Movie Database was used to try to predict their overall worldwide box office revenue.
Using machine learning techniques inputs from a train dataset was used to make revenue predictions based on the actual
revenue of each film in the set. Then the same machine learning models were performed on a separate test dataset where the
actual revenues were not provided.

An analysis of the train dataset was also performed, creating various charts and visualizations to determine the significance
and trends of the different inputs provided in the data, such as budget, runtime, popularity, cast, crew, orginal language,
production company, etc.

A website was also created showcasing the findings.
